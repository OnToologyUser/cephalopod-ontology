## Class : mantle length

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CEPH_0000160
 * *Label* = mantle length
 * *Definition* = (ML) - The standard measure of length in coleoid cephalopods. In decapodiforms ML is measured along the dorsal midline from the mantle margin to the posterior tip of the body, excluding long tails. In octopodiforms ML is measured from a line joining the midpoint of the eyes rather than the anterior mantle margin since the latter is obscured by the head/mantle fusion.
