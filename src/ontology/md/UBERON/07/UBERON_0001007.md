 * *Comment* = note that many anatomy ontologies consider gastrointestinal system synonymous with digestive system. here we follow MA in dividing digestive system into gastrointestinal and hepatobiliary. hepatobiliary includes the liver and biliary tract. species-specific AO classes are categorized according to whether liver is included. For example, XAO includes liver as part of XAO:0000125 alimentary system, so we assume this class is the more generic class
