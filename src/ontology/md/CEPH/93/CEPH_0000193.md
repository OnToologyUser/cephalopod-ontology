## Class : oviducal gland

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CEPH_0000193
 * *Label* = oviducal gland
 * *Definition* = Gland surrounding the end of the primary oviduct and responsible for secreting some of the external coatings over spawned eggs or, in incirrates, the cement at the base of the chorion stalk . In octopods it also acts as a spermatheca, and is located around the apparent middle of the oviduct. However, the &quot;distal oviduct&quot; is actually an extension of the oviducal gland.
