## Class : cephalopod penis

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CEPH_0000196
 * *Label* = cephalopod penis
 * *Definition* = The long, muscular end of the male gonoduct that assists in transfering spermatophores to the female. Apparently, in species with a hectocotylus, the penis transfers spermatophores to the hectocotylus which in turn transfers them to the female. In species without a hectocotylus, the penis is often greatly elongate, capable of extending beyond the mantle cavity and can, apparently, transfer spermatophores directly to the female.
