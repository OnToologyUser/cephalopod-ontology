## Class : cecum

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001153
 * *Label* = cecum
 * *Definition* = Pouch, connecting the ileum with the ascending colon of the large intestine. It is separated from the ileum by the ileocecal valve, and is the beginning of the large intestine. It is also separated from the colon by the cecocolic junction. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = Wikipedia:Cecum ]
 * *Comment* = The cecum is present in mammals and squid,[1] and two ceca are present in most birds (and some reptiles). Most herbivores have a relatively large cecum , hosting a large number of bacteria, which aid in the enzymatic breakdown of plant materials such as cellulose. Exclusive carnivores, whose diets contain little or no plant material, have a reduced cecum; often partially or wholly replaced by the vermiform appendix. It is in the large intestine which is near the small intestine.
