## Class : prechordal plate

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0003063
 * *Label* = prechordal plate
 * *Definition* = a thickening of the endoderm at the cranial end of the primitive streak formed by the involution of Spemann's organizer cells. The prechordal plate and the notochord induce the formation of the neural plate from the overlying ectodermal cells[GO]. Axial hypoblast located anterior to the chordamesoderm; the polster is its most anterior region[ZFA]. Uniquely thickened portion of the endoderm that is in contact with ectoderm immediately rostral to the cephalic tip of the notochord[WP].

## Synonyms

 * head mesenchyme
 * head mesoderm
