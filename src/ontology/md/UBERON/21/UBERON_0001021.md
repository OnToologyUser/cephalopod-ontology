 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001021
 * *Label* = nerve
 * *Definition* = an enclosed, cable-like bundle of peripheral axons [wikipedia]. A portion of tissue which is a fasiculated group of axons[ZFA]. Segment of neural tree organ which has as its parts a nerve trunk and its branches; together with other nerves of the same tree it constitutes a neural tree. Examples: chorda tympani, digastric branch of facial nerve, greater petrosal nerve, posterior cutaneous branch of posterior ramus of cervical nerve, superior lateral cutaneous nerve of arm[FMA].
