 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/CEPH_0000237
 * *Label* = spermatophore
 * *Definition* = A packet of sperm that is formed by the male and passed to the female during mating. In most coleoids, this packet is very complex and contains a &quot;rope&quot; of sperm (= sperm mass), an ejaculatory apparatus and a cement body. Except for the sperm, the entire structure is non-cellular and consists of a complex architecture of secreted material. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = http://tolweb.org/accessory/Cephalopod_Spermatophore_Terminology?acc_id=1972 ]
 * *Comment* = todo - create subclass for undischarged form
