 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 [IAO_0000116](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Intended meaning:
Ambiguous between continuant-parthood and occurrent-parthood.

domain: continuant
range: continuant
time: at some time

domain: occurrent
range: occurrent
time: atemporal
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/BFO_0000050 [IAO_0000116](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Parthood as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation p part_of p1 is illustrated in assertions such as: this instance of rhodopsin mediated phototransduction part_of this instance of visual perception.    This relation satisfies at least the following standard axioms of mereology: reflexivity (for all p, p part_of p); anti-symmetry (for all p, p1, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p then p and p1 are identical); and transitivity (for all p, p1, p2, if p part_of p1 and p1 part_of p2, then p part_of p2). Analogous axioms hold also for parthood as a relation between spatial regions.    For parthood as a relation between continuants, these axioms need to be modified to take account of the incorporation of a temporal argument. Thus for example the axiom of transitivity for continuants will assert that if c part_of c1 at t and c1 part_of c2 at t, then also c part_of c2 at t.    Parthood as a relation between classes: To define part_of as a relation between classes we again need to distinguish the two cases of continuants and processes, even though the explicit reference to instants of time now falls away. For continuants, we have C part_of C1 if and only if any instance of C at any time is an instance-level part of some instance of C1 at that time, as for example in: cell nucleus part_ of cell.

 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0001025 [IAO_0000116](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) Location as a relation between instances: The primitive instance-level relation c located_in r at t reflects the fact that each continuant is at any given time associated with exactly one spatial region, namely its exact location. Following we can use this relation to define a further instance-level location relation - not between a continuant and the region which it exactly occupies, but rather between one continuant and another. c is located in c1, in this sense, whenever the spatial region occupied by c is part_of the spatial region occupied by c1.    Note that this relation comprehends both the relation of exact location between one continuant and another which obtains when r and r1 are identical (for example, when a portion of fluid exactly fills a cavity), as well as those sorts of inexact location relations which obtain, for example, between brain and head or between ovum and uterus
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002160 [IAO_0000116](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) The original intent was to treat this as a macro that expands to 'in taxon' only ?Y - however, this is not necessary if we instead have supplemental axioms that state that each pair of sibling tax have a disjointness axiom using the 'in taxon' property - e.g.

 'in taxon' some Eukaryota DisjointWith 'in taxon' some Eubacteria
 * http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/RO_0002163 [IAO_0000116](../../IAO/16/IAO_0000116.md) There are two ways to encode this as a shortcut relation. The other possibility to use an annotation assertion between two classes, and expand this to a disjointness axiom.
