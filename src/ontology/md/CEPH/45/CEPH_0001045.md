 * *Definition* = Camerae (singular camera) are the spaces or chambers enclosed between two adjacent septa in the phragmocone of a nautiloid or ammonoid cephalopod. These can be seen in cross-sections of a nautilus shell and in the polished cross-sections of ammonites. In life these chambers are filled with gas, mediated by the siphuncle, and used to control buoyancy. [ [source](../../ce/source.md) = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_%28cephalopod%29 ]
