## Class : digestive tract

 * *IRI* = http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/UBERON_0001555
 * *Label* = digestive tract
 * *Definition* = Tube extending from the mouth to the anus. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Human_gastrointestinal_tract, [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?func=detail&amp;atid=440764&amp;aid=2991587&amp;group_id=36855 ]
 * *Comment* = GO says gut is region of DT, from intestines to anus. ZFA treats as synonym for alimentary canal, and treats it as the sum of DT + organs (ZF has no term from stomach). GO says intestines to anus (excludes stomach and esophagus). MA appears to agree with GO (stomach and esophagus are not parts). FMA includes stomach and esophagus as parts of gut -- the FMA divides gut into lower and upper GI tract; it's not clear if this is exhaustive (small intestine is in neither), but lower GI tract may correspond better to the GO definition. NOTE: GO now changed, see sf id in def xref. Note that FMA also has a term 'gastrointestinal tract', but this includes the liver
