 * *Label* = chorion
 * *Definition* = Anatomical structure that is contiguous with the embryo and is comprised of portions of tissue or cells that will not contribute to the embryo [ZFA]. The outer membrane of the two membranes enclosing the embryo in reptiles, birds, and mammals. In placental mammals it contributes to the development of the placenta[BTO]. Wikipedia: The chorion is one of the membranes that exists during pregnancy between the developing fetus and mother. It is formed by extraembryonic mesoderm and the two layers of trophoblast and surrounds the embryo and other membranes. The chorionic villi emerge from the chorion, invade the endometrium, and allow transfer of nutrients from maternal blood to fetal blood.
