 * *Label* = gland
 * *Definition* = A gland is an organ in an animal's body that synthesizes a substance for release such as hormones or breast milk, often into the bloodstream (endocrine gland) or into cavities inside the body or its outer surface (exocrine gland). A gland is an organ specialised for secretion[GO]. [ [database_cross_reference](../../ef/oboInOwl#hasDbXref.md) = Wikipedia:Gland ]
 * *Comment* = none of the major model vertebrate ontologies have a class called gland. Is this class superfluous? Also GO says secretion by tissue.
